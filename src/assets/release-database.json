            "Larval entities, waiting for a Live One...",
            "All possible worlds have their rhythm. Each spiral or sphere, each singular movement lives on these fluctuating bodies of code, carving their uninterpretable runes into the density of air. And among the spheres and the spirals, in the endless breathing of worlds, lie the sketches of mutating traditions. Modulations of ancestral voices that bounce off the glimmering walls of the future. Carriers of a necessary and placeless history. In beginning to map these channels, one immediately finds oneself enveloped by a crowd that knows how to draw on them. Borne along by this roaming mass, these teeming and bright multiplicities, one begins to live at this fragile limit that tears open the lattice of the actual. So that in this larval ritual, resonating, we find our greatest friends: those with that flickering awareness, who remind us that the secret of the world lies in its being reborn."

            "It is a great gift to have been shown that there are infinite ways to dissolve the I. Of course, the old routes are still available; one can always stretch oneself out to the point of bursting, expanding into that dance of pure prisms, where it all folds together, infinitely refracting. Mist of stasis and flux. Or one can go the other way, on an adventure that follows the curves of abstrusely vivid detail, losing ground again and again, forever abandoned to the play of giggling folds. We will never discount the value of these ageless maps (what “we” could?). But, still, it remains a great gift to be shown how all this calls us to that other process, to those moments where the grace of touch resounds, where life bursts at the limit, melting and beautiful."

Can we listen in to such a process? Our choices are limited, as one would expect; fragments recorded on failing and ancient radio technology, scribbled notes in a forgotten field guide. A barren list: insectual haunting, traces of the swarm, deep and immemorial bios, the violence of superlunary jungle winds. But a possibility breaks through the disintegrating chorus: reaching a pure voice-current, singing a moment that is barely thinkable, full of promise: the ultimate fracturing of the laws of motion."

            "This performance was recorded during a concert organized by Interzone at Montreal’s Saint-Édouard Church in February of 2023. For the occasion, we endeavored to invite musicians whom we knew would be able to affirm, and indeed \" magnify \" the remarkable acoustics of the space. Yves Charuest was the first to come to mind.",
            "Having played alongside many of the world's leading improvisers, including Peter Kowald (as part of the Peter Kowald Trio, 1985-1990), Louis Moholo, William Parker, Agustí Fernández, Roscoe Mitchell, Steve Noble, Benedict Taylor and Audrey Chen, Charuest has developed a singular approach, immediately recognizable for its keen sense of structural development over time and a meticulous attention to both the sonic qualities and the formal possibilities of the materials he works with.",
            "Charuest's improvisational practice cannot be reduced to a work on sound’s materiality or \" texture \" insofar as matter may resist formalization. Charuest’s modernism manifests in a refusal to isolate musical form or structure, more or less derived from \"tradition\", from sound as matter, too often conceived as passive exteriority: neither Boulez nor Zorn. What we hear instead is an elaboration that is as material as it is formal, forms slowly emerging from matter, a strange material loaded with more or less explicit figures, motifs and morphologies. Figures often so perplexing that they evoke the paradoxical constructions of M.C. Escher, impossible musical objects, making audible forces that are inaudible by themselves.",
            "Impossible does not mean abstract. Here, the impossible is felt, lived: too fast, too intense, a point of extreme tension. Not only for the ear, who will undoubtedly find itself overwhelmed, exasperated by a sound that bursts forth, now serene, now nervous, by silences that ring like rifts. More so, it is Charuest's approach that consists, in and of itself, of searching for and stretching toward this limit that separates the possible from the impossible, the \" will \" from the \" can \" of music. The effort is to stand on that frontier, to cling to this porous surface where the resistance of the material, of air and wood, of space and instant becomes a potential for elaboration: where, as Charuest himself puts it, instability is conducive to movement.",
            "Van Gogh wondered how to make his way through that invisible iron wall which seems to stand between what one feels and what one can do: \"how must one cross this wall, since striking hard at it doesn’t help at all; in my view, one must undermine the wall and go through it with a file, slowly and patiently…\". It is this wall, it is this limit that is at stake, always; and Charuest's work is a ceaseless passing to the limit; not a rejection or \"surpassing\" of technique and tradition, but the obstinate and methodical search for their exhaustion, towards something new.",
            "This exhaustion, this vulnerability — it is not a question of staging it, but of finding therein a condition, a support, perhaps a sign; to tend towards this mobile point where the intentional and the accidental, the highest activity and the frailest passivity converge: it is one of the moments of this search that we had the immense privilege to capture that evening, and to present today."

The cassette comes with graphic score transcriptions by Phoenix Reign Herring, one for each of the thirteen compositions, small, intricate maps for forking sound paths.",
            "This release is a collection of pictures, windows, vignettes. As the titles suggest, each piece here feels like a little scene, room or story – each opens a tiny, fleeting portal: tales of animals (frogs, pigs, rabbits, butterflies), rare drinks and special foods (nyquila sunrise), cosmic voyages, closing (well after midnight) with Cinderella’s birkenstock. Room to room, mirror to mirror, a door opens a door opens a door… until, maybe, a precarious, fragmented, colorful image of the whole can appear. And the whole is a whole world.",
            "Working exclusively from her computer, Fradkin displays, through extreme frequencies, a restraint and delicate touch often reminiscent of some of INA GRM’s classic releases. Never overbearing, never insisting upon itself, her conception is as rigorous as it is playful (Beatriz Ferreyra, Robert Cahen, or Tom Cameron’s synth experiments come to mind); it unfolds with the unhurried assurance of a fully formed vision, telling its tales, cutting its perspectives, searching for its dazzling diamonds with the minuteness of a goldsmith, or the bright-eyed curiosity of a small animal gathering shiny objects.",
            "Side B shifts the act into a higher intensity, as the quartet delivers a taut, heavily articulated blend of electronic and acoustic elements. Striking here is the degree of musicality maintained in duration, in and through living mayhem (striking yet not surprising, as Elbaz, Stemeseder, and Istrefi are prominent figures in New York City’s free improvisation spheres). The resulting scenes are explosive, unpredictable (is that... a harpsichord? church bells? a traffic jam?), at times outright comical, playing through tension, horror, humor, confusion, always carried by an unrelenting lyricism.",
            "Experienced in its entirety, this double-debut-album often left us at a loss for words; we at Interzone are indeed struggling to express how grateful we are to be able to welcome such exceptional musicians into our catalogue. F*rtility, abundance, new beginnings, and good luck…!"
